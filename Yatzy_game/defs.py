    - To choose the position you want to apply the score on
    of the specific player, enter the number next to a 'Score'
    (the program will display which player turn it is)
    - After each round you MUST input a score on a position OR 
    scratch that score, you can do that with a 'zero'(0)
    - You will get a bonus if you have 63 points or more on the first six scores
    - There are 14 rounds total in Yatzy, that is when the whole 
    protocol has been filled in
    - You can always quit the game by pressing 'Q'
    - Write "quit" in dice mode to kill the program
    - To choose specific 'rolled dices' insert the dice numbers with a space between
    them, for exampel: 1 3 5 will give you the first third and fifth dice you rolled
    - You can roll dices TWO times
